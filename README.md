## About me

I'm `dktapps`, sometimes known as the black cat, or just Dylan.
I'm a software developer and reverse engineer based in the UK.

### Open-source experience
[<img align=right src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b45fdbd6-82a8-4d1f-8cfb-d43c5f02e3e9" height="150" width="150">](https://www.credly.com/badges/0f3d802f-02d7-40e6-aec2-02ea16a55a3d/public_url)

In the last 10 years, I've contributed to, and led the development of, various popular open-source projects.

I'm well-known in the Minecraft: Bedrock custom server community for leading the development of [PocketMine-MP, a custom Minecraft: Bedrock server software](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) since 2016.

In 2024 I received an award on [OpenUK's 2024 Honours List](https://www.credly.com/badges/0f3d802f-02d7-40e6-aec2-02ea16a55a3d/public_url) as one of the 100 most influential open-source software engineers in the UK.

### Work experience
I've mostly worked with developer teams on Minecraft multiplayer game servers.
I've worked with [Lifeboat Survival Games](https://lbsg.net) since 2020, a top 3 Minecraft-partnered multiplayer server hosting thousands of players every day.

However, I'm interested in getting into something new, as I feel I've learned as much as I can from Minecraft.

### Skills
- Effective & creative at solving problems
- Managing large popular open-source projects with large API surfaces
- PHP, Java, C, C++, C#, Golang programming languages
- Reverse engineering native C++ binaries using tools like [Hex-Rays IDA](https://hex-rays.com/)
- Familiar with popular tools such as Docker and MySQL
